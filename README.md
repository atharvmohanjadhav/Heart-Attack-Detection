# Heart-Attack-Detection
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to detect the likelihood of a heart attack. By analyzing various health metrics such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical data, our model will learn to identify patterns and predict the risk of a heart attack.
